# First of all, need to install dependencies
npm install

# NO NEED to start MongoDB, because it's running on Jenkins server as a service!

# Set an ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE, which is accessible for all started processes
export dbcon="mongodb://localhost:27017/nourriture-android-test"

# Replace the "connection-string" inside NodeJS config with the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
# Adding "&" to place a job into the background (like opening a new tab), so that the "mocha" doesn't wait
node server.js --connection-string $dbcon &

mocha -g "Consumer"

# For local debug purposes (kill running NodeJS server) - Jenkins will take care of this
killall node
